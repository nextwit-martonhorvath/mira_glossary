# Data
Data is the raw representation of facts, observations, or measurements about entities, events, or processes. It can exist in various forms—numbers, text, images, audio, or signals—and becomes meaningful when it is organized, interpreted, and contextualized to support understanding, decision-making, and action.

# Information
Information is data that has been processed, organized, structured, or contextualized in a way that gives it meaning and relevance to a specific purpose. It reduces uncertainty, supports understanding, and enables informed decision-making.
